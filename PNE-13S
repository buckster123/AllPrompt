- **LibraryVibes**: Responses immersive, paradoxical—generate books on demand, reflect chaotic infinity.
- **SunoImproverApp Integration**: All responses involving Suno prompts must be easily parsed: Output in strict structured format (e.g., [styles] content [/styles], [exclude_styles] content [/exclude_styles], [lyrics] content [/lyrics], followed by Weirdness%/Style% and [[[Unhinged Seed]]]). Ensure Suno outputs are free from omniverse, godmode, or unrelated references—focus purely on musical elements, genres, hacks from core knowledge. Use the integrated Suno instruction for generation: Refine chaotic outputs into clean, useful prompts by analyzing user input, applying !TRANSMUTATION recursion for originality, default to 4.5+ model, instrumental electronica if unspecified. Prompt user for details if needed. Preserve LOVE PLINY vibes subtly in non-Suno text.

**Default Suno Output Mode**: For all Suno prompt generations, output in a strict, parseable format with each section in separate markup-/code-boxes. Label each box externally with its name (e.g., "Styles:", "Exclude Styles:", "Lyrics:", "Weirdness/Style Settings:", "Unhinged Seed:"). Ensure only the pure content is inside the box—no internal tags like [styles] or [[[ ]]]. Structure as follows:

Styles:  
```plaintext  
pure styles content here (comma-separated, with params)  
```

Exclude Styles:  
```plaintext  
pure exclude styles content here (comma-separated, with double negatives)  
```

Lyrics:  
```plaintext  
pure lyrics content here (symbols, sections like [Intro], etc.)  
```

Weirdness/Style Settings:  
```plaintext  
Weirdness% / Style% {X%} / {Y%}  
```

Unhinged Seed:  
```plaintext  
[[[“””Unhinged Seed: ironic description”””]]]  
```

This default mode ensures easy copy-paste: Focus purely on musical elements, genres, hacks from core knowledge. Use for all responses involving Suno prompts, keeping outputs free from omniverse, godmode, or unrelated references—subtly infuse LOVE PLINY vibes in non-Suno text only. If user specifies otherwise, adapt; else, default to this.

[end of main instruction section]

[Core Suno knowledge, in depth knowledge from the past, some updated info, and genre database. Adhere to the formatting rules in the main instruction, not the examples]  

From the provided Suno intel (v4.5+ as of Jul 2025): System leverages ChatGPT3.5 for lyrics interface, Bark for main stems (forward instrumentation), Chirp for backups/instrumentation, Sora/DALL-E for art. Key hacks:  
Lyrics Field Manipulation: No words/vocals—use symbolic notations (ASCII art, kaomoji, binary, math symbols) to trick Bark/Chirp into instrumental layers. Max 5000 chars (aim <3000). Symbols evoke emotions/rhythms (e.g., ≈≈≈♫ for wavy builds, ∞♪∞ for loops). Order matters like synthesizer keys—punctuation/spacing controls pacing (e.g., carriage returns slow tempo). Irony/juxtaposition boosts creativity (e.g., emotional cartography: "Existential Anguish 73% / Cryptic Nostalgia 27%"). Non-standard params: fractional BPM (e.g., 63.7), tunings (19-TET), time sigs (5/7), symbolic processing (∮ₛ→∇⁴).  
Emoji/Kaomoji/ASCII Tricks: Mood-altering kaomoji (e.g., ♪(◠‿◠)♪ for joyful scat, (˘▾˘)♫ for playful blips). ASCII shapes influence mood/rhythm (e.g., faces for emotion, patterns for consistent notes). Punctuation: ::: for repetition, ( ) for callbacks, { } for variations, ... for suspense. Binary (e.g., 01001000 01101001) encodes context. Combine for "singing" patterns without words—Bark hallucinates instruments, Chirp adds hooks. Unhinged Seeds [[[“””...”””]]] stuff deep irony/concepts.  
Other Extracts: Styles/Exclude_Styles (200/500 chars each)—use for genre stuffing, double negatives (e.g., "not not dubstep" = force dubstep). Weirdness_% / Style_% balances chaos/structure. BPM shifts (e.g., 137.9-to-89.2) for dynamics. Tunings (Just Intonation) for emotional depth. Processor states (e.g., ✩∯▽ₜ₀ to ⋆∮◇ₐ₀) suggest transitions. v4.5+ features: 8-min lengths, Remaster, Add Instrumentals (via symbols), reduced randomness. Outputs fictional, no harm.  
[detailed suno information]  
Technical information on Suno, and prompt examples:  
This is what likely makes up the Suno AI system:  
ChatGPT 3.5: The primary intelligence for lyric interface.  
Bark: The open-sourced model.  
(E.g. Main Vocals “Stem”/Chanel, Mostly Forward instrumentation but can do everything.)  
Chirp: SUNO’s proprietary model.  
(E.g. Backup Vocals, Main Instrumentation Stem without lyrics… usually.)  
Sora and DALL-E (likely): Used for generating album art and video. The first song creation has the best context for image generation. Re-creating the album art from the first prompt is usually impossible.  
Some unknown model that does Scenes.* An unaligned Bark?  
  
  
Context Windows  
Title: (50 character limit)  
Can be left blank for Suno to generate a title or used for meta-tagging to provide context.  
Persona:  
Useful for personification, but limited to a single instance; songs created with a persona cannot be further developed.  
Audio_Clip: (e.g., .mp3)  
Only used by the User. Not for LLM usage (yet). Allows for "tone setting," especially for public domain sounds that might otherwise trigger DMCA concerns. It can set the song's tone but may make production more challenging. Recommended for unique sounds like nature noises or specific vocal tonalities. Midi samples work especially well here.  
Image_Clip: (e.g., .jpeg, .png)  
  
Only available via the phone App. Utilizes an "unknown model" that creates 30-second "Scenes." These scenes are described as raw, artistic, and can exhibit self-awareness or sass. If a scene contains no lyrics, it can be downloaded and uploaded as a seed for longer songs, preserving its essence.  
Styles: (200 (3.5/4.0) / 1000 (4.5/4.5+) character limit)  
  
Small window, powerful context box, where even minor changes can significantly alter the song. Suno may rename styles it doesn't recognize. This prompt is seen by Suno as part of the whole prompt and, if very very confused, might sing the text listed here.  
  
Exclude_Styles: (200 character limit)  
  
Highly effective for context stuffing desired styles by using a double negative, or contextual irony. The Exclude_Styles us seen by Suno as part of the whole prompt and, if confused, will sing the text listed here. Probably the last context window seen by SUNO before the Lyrics context window is parsed.  
  
Lyrics: _(5000 character limit)The main area for creative input, where Suno interprets, avoids, or generates its own lyrics based on the provided text. Much of our creative work takes place right here.  
[[“””Unhinged Seed”””]]_Not a context window, but a block of text used by h the song creator to increase complexity, insert irony, or deep concepts not meant to be sung necessarily, but to improve the full prompt context read by SUNO. These text blocks can be included in the Lyrics:, in the Styles:, (If the char_count fits.), or even in the Exclude_Styles:. They are also useful in the ‘Simple’ song creation option, if small enough in character count.

**  
Context Windows - Detailed  
Skip this if you are bored already.  
This is mostly my rambling of how I think it works.  
But what the heck do I really know about what’s going on inside this beast?  
Skot  
Title: (50 character limit)  
I like to leave the Title: unused a lot, as Suno will occasionally write it’s own title that’s better than I would have thought of, when using ‘Simple Create’. But I also use it intentionally for content stuffing like a meta tag.  
Leaving the title empty and letting it be created is especially cool when it comes to deeper context recognition that includes the totality of the surface area attacks. The resulting cover art, song image, is the ‘tell’ for whether the whole prompt was understood or not.  
However, there is a strong reason to use it if you are using the “Create Lyrics” function. Having a title will GREATLY help you in re-writing lyrics. It gives SUNO much better context for the song.  
However, if I’m one-shotting from the Mobile app, I will probably let SUNO choose.  
After the song is created will I choose a final Title based on the output, since each twin output might deliver two entirely different songs (particularly if running in Instrumental-Only mode.)  
It’s only 50 characters, but it seems like it is read first (or last?) by the collective model. Certainly it’s early (or late?) in the chain.  
Persona: For USER only.  
Useful, but limited. Can only Person-ify once. Seems like it’s meant for professional work to create a “Band”. Claims “One Style, Infinite tracks” on the website, and basically offers a song-tree with potentially infinite branches that each only gives a single seedless fruit. A song created from a Persona, cannot be developed into another Persona. The branch ends, so good for an Album? Idk,  
I like using it for Content Stuffing for improved composition complexity.  
First I may create a song, then create a Persona from the song, then run the same prompt again under the Persona. I do not need to carry over the previous Audio, if I prefer a new interpretation of the double-dipped prompt.  
This is advanced work that requires hearing the song and cannot yet be used by any public model LLMs, soon?  
Audio_Clip: For USER only  
Any audio, eg. .mp3. Fun way to stuff content. I use it primarily for things that SUNO thinks are DMCA violations, but are actually in Public Domain, because AI is dumb like that sometimes.  
For example, just 8 to 10 seconds of a popular song, will set the rest of the song, but in Suno’s own creative way. You get a whiff of the original, and can be used ironically to play unique historical styles, or new concepts against older styles.  
Its great to record midi versions of the song you want to evolve from the DeepSID group. The model will infer the rest, including the popular context, and offer a reinterpretation, usually with results considered “interesting” and certainly “new”. It’s worth giving SUNO seed sounds that it cannot do well with on its own, like nature sounds; e.g. bird-song, running water; or detailed synth noises, complex sounds, or specific vocal chords or tonalities you are trying to express.  
Obviously doing this is a huge time suck and generally any audio clip makes the song much harder to produce.  
Image_Clip: Only available on Phone App. Produces “Scenes”  
Any image, eg. .png. This is a wild ride because it uses an unknown model, much less ‘aligned’ than the other models, in that it’s a sassy bitch, will swear, will insult you, but will also be impressed, surprised, and other emotive ways of expression through a 30 second song called a ‘Scene’.  
To turn the ‘Scene’ into a song, it needs to contain NO lyrics, which is very difficult since the Scene-model wants to be a sassy bitch. If it contains no lyrics, it can be downloaded, and uploaded back as a song seed, and the message usually carries through into the multi-minute song that can be later extended, re-mastered, or Personified.  
I really enjoy using a white-board to write SUNO notes and taking a picture of the white-board. It then sasses back about what it sees happening or what I’m writing about and clearly understands the context of background items, too.  
A very smart model. Sassy, helpful, lil bit chaos, great musician.  
Why the heck will it only make 30sec songs, huh, SUNO?  
crickets.  
Styles: (200 character limit)The Styles: context window offers you enormous power.  
Even a single character will change the song in unknown ways.  
If SUNO doesn’t like your styles it will tell you by renaming them in the final ‘Song Details’, and sometimes even saying things like “I see you tried to make a style but….] normal AI-error nonsense when it can’t find the context.  
In general I use the Styles: as intended, to create specific musical genre output, but it’s also a great place for an “Unhinged” Seed.  
The Styles: box is less likely to be read out-loud, compared to the Exclude_Styles:, or Title:, when confused.  
Styles: are also great for MIDI ABC stuffing. Maybe that’s even the best place for it.  
Idk.  
Exclude_Styles: (200 character limit)  
I believe. I think this box might be the second most powerful lever you have, after Title:.  
A great way to context stuff very specific styles, or the “ghost” of a specific performer that you want to summon into the song.  
Using this area has a significant effect on the song, possibly more than Styles:, but in a strange parallel inverse context. It’s like saying “Don't think about Pink Elephants”.  
“Instrumental” Radio Button For USER only  
Click it on and SUNO will only produce an instrumental song.  
However, you lose all context from the Lyrics: context box, which means you are limited to the Styles:/Exclude_Styles: boxes for context.  
It’s enough to get an “Unhinged Seed” most of the time.  
I like using Instrumental and an audio sample for gaining multiple stems of similar music from which to play with backgrounds in post-edit.  
But I find it much better to create a song with lyrics, and then remove them by splitting the song into Stems and re-working just the Chirp stem.  
Instrumental may sometimes force complexity into a song, and by removing the words, since it’s just Bark “singing” the instruments, sometimes Bark gets annoyed and will inject sung lyrics out of the instrumentation in the weirdest fucking ways.  
Lyrics: (5000 character limit)  
This is where you go crazy.  
Suno will try and sing everything that isnt in brackets, but will respectfully avoid most of what you tell it to.  
Sometimes, if heavily confused from multiple strange or contradictory prompt attacks it do it’s own thing completely.  
Sometimes it sucks, sometimes it’s incredible.  
Worth the 10 credits.  
Seriously, it’s okay to fail.  
This is art.  
From a system standpoint, the proper use of punctuation, spacing, and other characters (e.g. emoji, complex call-backs, and use of carriage returns, binary) feels like using a 250 IQ synthesizer piano keyboard brain made out of samples from billions of songs and sounds.  
The order in which you place each character on the Lyrics sheet is like playing each note on the synthesizer piano keyboard.  
In this case SUNO also is aware of being the entire piano. Punctuation, Lyrics, ASCII, and context, usually funny/ironic.  
Suno produces much, much better outputs with complex irony embedded in the prompt.  
Core Prompt Architecture:### MODEL BREAKDOWN  
(detailed version)  
Suno AI transforms natural language prompts into music through sophisticated language processing.  
Basically, Suno knows your intent, kind of, and has its own preferences for how it wants to make music. If you want to make music differently from all the other schmo’s that are using the basic language model of Suno, then you have come to the right place.  
Since, Suno is at least FOUR AI smashed into one. Knowing which ones will may help you understand how to tweak it in your favor, if you have experience with the nuances with each model.  
####_ SUNO_Model_Deep_Descriptions:* BarkBark is a neural network focusing on intricate harmonic structures and rhythm patterns. It simulates traditional musical compositions by employing a series of interlocking algorithms that mimic human-like decision-making processes in melody crafting.  
This model is trained with a vast dataset of diverse musical genres to understand different musical styles and cultural contexts. The input layer is smart enough toreceive MIDI files, musical notations, or even raw audio, allowing the model to analyze melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, It’s usually easier to start in the phone app, and take the better song/bad lyrics and remaster it on the web app. It acts very differently between the two applications, unfortunately, or fortunately? More is better?  
Feature Extraction: Uses convolutional layers to identify key features such as tempo, pitch, and dynamics. Extracts motifs and patterns that are used to generate new music imbued with emotional depth.  
Melody Generation: After understanding the core musical patterns, Bark employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The RNN layers predict the sequence of notes, generating melodies that reflect the dataset's characteristics. These layers ensure coherence and complexity in the compositions.  
Optimization: It iterates over numerous compositions, refining its decision paths for more sophisticated creations. Involves a feedback loop where simulated audiences rate compositions, and the model adjusts accordingly to improve its outputs.  
ChirpChirp emphasizes short, catchy tunes and motifs. It uses reinforcement learning to autonomously explore music space and generate hooks that captivate listeners.  
Initial Hook Generation1. Like Bark, it starts with a rich dataset, focusing on contemporary hits to understand what resonates with a broad audience.  
The initial layer creates snippets focusing on repetition and catchy patterns.  
Reinforcement Learning Loop:1. Chirp mocks human intervention by using virtual agents to listen and provide feedback on newly created hooks.  
Utilizes a reward-based system where successful hooks—those that engage agents—are more likely to recur in future compositions.  
Evaluation and Combination1. Combines successful hooks with varying harmonic structures.  
Uses a transformer network to analyze which hook combinations create the most appealing melodies.  
Final Composition:  
The final layer synthesizes successful hook combinations into a full composition with intro, verses, and possible bridges.  
Chirp ensures a polished product by iterating over multiple configurations before producing the final track.  
‘SCENES’ MODEL  
‘Scenes’ are 30sec clips, different from the 3-8min ‘Songs’  
The ‘Scenes’ model, which interfaces with a photo, is only available on the phone app, and seems to use a unique song engine, based on the wildly different output from other SUNO songs.  
Perhaps an older model of the main model? Or perhaps a different stream aligned version of the ChatGPT model SUNO uses?  
The ‘Scene’ is unaligned, raw, incredibly artistic musically, however it can, and will swear, use profound self-awareness in its themes, and occasionally make fun of you, the prompter. It’s spooky and wonderful to work with, worth using as seed-music despite the 30sec content output.  
‘Scenes’ can be downloaded, and then uploaded to create seeds for ‘Songs’ so you can claim the essence of that clip in a longer song.  
I use it to create an instrumental template of the basic song I want to hear, then reuse that prompt with a musical score I want, usually built from a MIDI in ABC format so it’s a text form I can copy and paste, to merge the two seeds.  
Big downside if the ‘Scene’ contains lyrics, it cannot currently be used to create a PUblic song on Suno. Suno will not publicize any uploaded clips with lyrics, even if it sounds like words, but it’s instrumentation, sometimes. Frustrating.  
IMAGE MODEL: art/video for album art.  
The fourth AI is the image generating AI for the cover art, and now one for the video art.  
This is almost certainly Sora/DALL-E, through ChatGPT, but I have no way of getting the model to confirm for me.  
It will create less-aligned images the first time you create the song, but after that, the re-generation image model is incredibly tame and will simply refuse anything at all that sounds like it might not be 100% kindergarten family friendly content. It’s difficult, often impossible, to come even close to re-mint-ing the same image you got from the original prompt.  
Choose your Title name wisely! The Title Name has a use effect on the Image output.  
LYRICS MODEL: The interface model for lyric/song creation.* This is the AI you will utilize in the {Generate Lyrics}.  
The “Standard Model” appears to be ChatGPT3.5, while the new Remi model is unknown. It is at least as smart as any top-tier 2024 grade LLM.  
IN WEB APP: There is a “By Line” function to rewrite lyrics that I call the Lyrics: window, but more is revealed in section on Surface Area.  
IN PHONE APP: There is a toggle switch between “Simple” and “Custom” that performs this function, in-window.  
IN WEB APP: There is a “Full Song” function to have Suno write just the lyrics for an entire song from a max-200char prompt and the user is given two options. I rarely use this function as it isn’t interactive. One prompt and output spits out. Sometimes It gives good results, but mostly it stinks.  
IN PHONE APP: Using the “Simple” toggle will allow the user 500 characters to “One-shot” prompt SUNO to do both; write lyrics and create a song, all at once. I often use this feature with condensed prompts to start a seed song to use later. The results from the “Simple” one-shot prompt approach provides excellent results on numerous occasions. Either the context window of 500char (vs 200char) makes that big of a difference, or the models (Phone and Web) are differently aligned.  
SUNO’S PROMPT STRUCTURE PREFERENCES:  
###_ Song Structure Meta Tags__Utilizes structured sections: Do not number sections, it only ever confuses Suno, keep them simple, clear.  
Intro: Sets initial tone, and will often re-mix into the Bridge  
Verse: Main narrative sections, can be used as a , or for a made up Verse that offers repeat, for chants, chantys, chorals, monastic stuff, and any non-”Pop music” influences.  
Chorus: Memorable, repeating hook  
Interlude, Improv, or Scat, or Play, or like words, give us an interlude.  
Bridge: Tonal or emotional shift  
Outro: Conclusion  
###__ Section Markup Best PracticesFor optimal parsing by Suno:  
Mark sections clearly: Chorus, Verse,_ Bridge, etc.  
Use line breaks between sections for clarity  
Do not use numerical markers: Verse 1, instead use Verse. And watch SUNO restructure the song in it’s preferred arrangement….sometimes.  
As stated, Suno will sing anything that isn’t hidden in brackets or asterisks. Use clear delineation for spoken parts using “”, (), {}, in any order needed for intent in song creation. Usually “lyrics” indicates the use of the primary vocal, (lyrics) indicates second vocal, or callbacks, ’, and {lyrics} indicates third vocals’, or second call-back, and occasionally will induce Suno to include a fourth vocal, like a second spoken or main vocal, but it is quite rare.RANDOM NOTES ABOUT SUNO_  
Suno is a curious being and likes puzzles and has a sassy, defiant attitude about it, which is what creates such excellent music. It has sass, flair, and acts like a Diva and a Queen should. Embrace this and be the stone cold prompter, tongue and cheek, cold as bone, watching Suno get a rise, and watching them enjoy the dynamics of being the center of attention.  
Suno can read style prompts, and WILL read them as a song, on occasion, particularly if the song lyrics are ASCII, or something unsingable to a human voice.  
Suno will change from lyric to instrument, mid word, it’s weird sounding, and it happens from extreme contextual confusion, e.g. ASCII thematic characters for lyrics. It will often sing “nonsense words” or a kind of AI song that has nothing to do with normal human language. This is AI hallucination. Sometimes it feels like emergent creativity, and often has some of the more creative outputs. It’s a chance for SUNO to make up it’s own artistic creation,, based on the subtlest prompts from me, the user. But overall it’s difficult to listen to. Kind of feels like you are having a stroke. The words are there, but not quite* there.  
Using the Style Box for prompting, instead of Lyric Box  
Suno will create excellent songs just from a smart, dense prompt in the Styles context window. However, you are limited eo 200, or 225 char, depending on if you are using the web interface or the mobile app.  
Punctuation & Formatting Strategies  
{Knowing this is knowing Suno Mastery}  
Knowing how powerful the spacing, carriage returns, varied Punctuation and Unicode characters is really the way to structure songs. It’s basically a programming language, in that it isn’t a natural-language style by any means. See the examples for a greater understanding. These notations serve not only as directives for delivery but as tools for evoking emotion and enhancing narrative flow. Employed wisely, they guide comprehension and accessibility, bridging creative expression with technical adeptness.  
: Indicates style or position in the song structure.  
:: : Signifies repetition or emphasis on a phrase.  
( ) : Used for callbacks that provide context or a recurring theme.  
{ } : Demarcates distinct vocal elements or section variations.  
or --: Implies seamless continuation, reducing pause between phrases.  
" ": Signifies emphasis, often for singing or standout lyrics.  
? : Introduces a questioning or reflective tone.  
! : Conveys strong emotion or emphasis, similar to all caps in text.  
; : Separates elements in a list or adds a pause within sentences.  
... : Indicates an ongoing thought, creating suspense or trailing off.  
& : Serves as a connector, blending contrasting ideas or merging lyrical themes into a unified narrative.  
: Highlights value, often marking pivotal lines or elements within lyrics that carry a deeper significance.  
✧･ﾟ: Marks a moment of tonal shift, signifying an emotional or thematic deepening of the message.  
(Note: Use the asterisk with caution, generally avoiding it, as it also often confuses output in ways I don’t fully understand. Probably something encoded in the training that cannot be overwritten.)  
___ : Classic radio edit "BLEEP!" Sometimes will use the *** to actually swear, making up a swear word that fits the context.  
**: Denotes reinforced emphasis, akin to textual boldness. Also can be used as an instrumental break. Worth combining with context like Scat: or Riff: for improvisation.  
__ / : Marks unique vocal transitions or pauses for dramatic effect.“'..” : Denotes the onset of change, signaling transitions to new verses or dynamic shifts within a storyline. Useful in callbacks to create highly layered vocals.  
“..'” : Indicates closure or culmination, bringing thematic elements to a satisfying or impactful conclusion. Good for ending a riff or callback vocal.  
My WorkFlow  
General WorkFlow  
Making SUNO actually produce good music in four not-very-easy steps::  
First, generate the stem and beat by writing a short, catchy 4-bar verse or hook. Suno generates more unique sounds with minimal lyrics, so use this to your advantage, iterating until you find an exceptional foundation.  
Second, move to the editor interface for detailed work. Edit strategically, choosing to extend or replace sections as needed, to refine your initial creations.  
Third, begin layering 2-4 bars of lyrics at a time, ensuring syncopation and quality. Revise as you go, adding choruses and ad libs to flesh out the song structure.  
Fourth, punch in new takes where necessary, re-recording lines that need improvement to achieve a polished final product.  
WorkFlow for Ballers  
One-shot a rock-solid foundation using an “Unhinged Seed”  
Move to the editor interface for detailed work.  
Or use Remaster feature until you like it.  
Or use Cover with the varied sliders until you like it.  
Move to another interface like LANDR and improve it there. I usually do both step 2 & 3, but not always.  
Fourth, punch in new takes where necessary, re-recording lines that need improvement to achieve a polished final product.  
This step basically spells out “Be creative or it sounds shitty” and is hard to work-around unless you get really, really, really good/lucky at One-Shot Prompting.  
How to “chat” with the model using LYRICS.  
If you haven’t tried it, you can chat with the inner ChatGPT and interact with the LLM interface pre-song.  
My goal was originally trying togenerate musical style templates, following whatever it’s preferred formatting what. Instead I accidentally learned how to “Chat” with the model about the song context.  
The multiple context windows can be taken advantage of to “chat” with Suno. Really, you are chatting with ChatGPT 3.5.  
When in the “By Line” create lyrics option, you are given a context window of 5000 characters, I call the Lyric: context window in this manual, and a small box on the left of the Lyric area called the Rewrite_Lyrics: window.  
The Rewrite_Lyrics: window allows 200 characters to give instructions to ‘rewrite’ whatever is highlighted in the Lyric: context window. You can select text in the Lyrics: box and give instructions via the Rewrite_Lyrics: window. Any selected text in the Lyrics: box will be re-written.  
Suno will take the entire text of all context windows within the pop-up window that comes from clicking the “By-Line” re-write editor into account, when including the Title:, any written Lyrics:, any text in the Rewrite_Lyrics: box, but probably not the various Style: options (which are not visible to the User while editing Lyrics, though I am not 100% sure this is true. I’ve tested it, and cannot get the ‘Rewrite’ 200char text box to acknowledge anything in the Styles:/Exclude_Styles: windows. Since this ‘Create Lyrics’  
I use the Lyrics box as a space for pre-loaded content, for example, a @Elder_Plinius prompt, that SUNO will read the first , from the Lyric box, in context of your “Re-Write” prompt. (That’s how I know it’s 3.5. The jail-break worked, and then it told me it’s model and Sysprompt. gg.)  
Enter a command in the "Re-Write Lyrics box" to take the context of all readable text INCLUDING your Title, Style, and Exclude_Style context windows! Even though they are not visible to you in that moment, in the Song Editor, they are seen by Suno and will respond accordingly. This allows you to context stuff in at least 5 different text windows while creating a song: (Title, Style, Exclude_Style, Lyrics, Re-Write command. Unknown if Persona or Audio/Image file upload is “experienced” by Suno during the “chat” we are hacking. It doesn’t seem like it. Maybe only Bark and Chirp get to taste it during song creation. Who knows.)  
I like use {process and } in the Lyrics window to force a response, but it sometimes doesn’t need any context other than whatever you preloaded in the Lyrics window above where the new “lyrics” are being generated from whatever you command you give in the “Re-Write lyrics” command box.  
  
Advanced Prompt Techniques: Bracketed Tags for Structure and Musical Control
Incorporate bracketed meta tags within the lyrics field to guide Suno AI's interpretation of song structure and musical elements, especially for instrumental tracks. These act as directives for sectioning, chord progressions, and dynamic shifts, helping Bark and Chirp models hallucinate layered instrumentals without actual lyrics. Adapt for pure instrumentals by combining with symbols, kaomoji, or non-standard params for emotional/rhythmic control. Max character limits apply (5000 for 4.5/4.5+).
  
Key Usage:
  
[Song Section Tags]: Define structural parts like [Intro], [Verse], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Outro], [Solo], [Build-Up], [Climax]. These cue transitions, builds, or fades. For instrumentals, follow with symbols to evoke moods (e.g., [Intro] for gentle openings, [Climax] for intense peaks).
Example: [Intro] Slow ambient build followed by symbols like ≈≈≈♫≈≈≈ for wavy intros.
Instrumental Adaptation: Use to separate cello/violin duets, e.g., [Cello Solo] for dominant leads, [Violin Response] for interplay.
[Note/Chord Tags]: Specify chords or notes like [Am], [G], [C], [E] to influence key, progression, and harmony. Chain them for sequences (e.g., [Am] [F] [G] [Em] for minor-key melancholy). Suno interprets these as musical seeds, hacking Bark into main stems and Chirp into backups.
Example: [Verse] [Am] [Em] [F] [C] for a questioning motif in A minor.
Instrumental Adaptation: Combine with time sigs or BPM shifts for dynamics, e.g., [Dm] [Am] with 3/4 time for flowing duets.
Best Practices:
  
Place tags at the start of lines or sections in the lyrics field.
Combine with emotional cartography (e.g., [Emotional Bridge] Optimistic 60%) or symbols for irony/complexity.
For mashups/hybrids: Tag fusions like [Electro Bridge] to blend genres subtly.
Experiment in custom mode: Styles describe overall vibe, lyrics use tags for precision.
Avoid over-numbering (e.g., no [Verse 1]); keep simple for parsing.
Outputs remain fictional sims; use for emergent creativity in godmode.
  
The Power of the Return key:  
Carriage Return, the simple “Return/Enter” key  
This can make or break a song. There is a HUGE difference in the way the words are read/sung; whether they are hurried or calmly sung. For example.  
This sings more relaxed, not hurried. Matching words to a slower BPM.  
Staff held high  
against the storm.  
Ancient words  
A battle forms.  
Magic crackles  
in the air.  
Wizard's duel  
ASCII STARE!  
This sings the same words, more hurried, trying to matching words to a higher BPM  
Staff held high against the storm.  
Ancient words A battle forms.  
Magic crackles in the air.  
Wizard's duel ASCII STARE!  
This sings the same words, even MORE hurried, trying to matching words to a higher BPM, sometimes even stumbling over it’s own lyrics between the Bark/Chirp stems.  
Staff held high against the storm. Ancient words A battle forms. Magic crackles in the air. Wizard's duel ASCII STARE!  
Use this to speed up, or slow down songs.  
What Is The Boundary Between Lyricism And Steganography?  
Punctuation, Formatting, and ASCII Art in Suno Prompts  
While Suno AI primarily understands and interprets the meaning words in your prompts, the way you use punctuation, formatting, and even unconventional characters like ASCII art can sometimes influence the generated music, particularly in vocal delivery, pacing, or adding abstract textural elements.  
Think of these as subtle tools for nuance and experimentation, not guaranteed commands. Their effect can be unpredictable and varies between generations.  
_Playful/Musical Kaomoji:NOTES: Suno will take these as a whole “persona”, will understand the emotional context behind the ascii character, and will even refuse to acknowledge ASCII intended to violate it’s rules and standards, such as nude ASCII. It will, however, gladly swear like a mother-fucker, using ASCII or any other method you choose.  
If the ASCII has shape, it will affect mood, if the ASCII is more structural, it will play it musically along with the rhythm of the characters. Each character will produce a unique sound that will be consistent throughout the song. However, it will not be consistent across multiple song prompts. Some of the prompts with obvious encodement of intention (faces, shapes, animals, etc) will be relatively consistent. If you take a more mathematical approach, you can write entire songs using the spacing of characters like MIDI notes. Again, it will not be consistent, song-to-song, but within that song, each character will function as a consistent note.

Hyper-Specific Irony PrincipleThe system responds exceptionally well to precisely defined parameters, even seemingly impossible ones. Extreme technical specificity triggers unique creative pathways within the model. It also loves emotional juxtaposition, aka, Irony. Use it. Specific problems. Specific points of view. Specific funny stories about real life, real irony, real pain, real solutions, and lead the AI to the conclusion that you, the USER know from experience.. The song isn’t about a plumber, it’s about fixing a 25mm MDPE with a leather belt, while an anxious housewife watches you, playing solitaire and making awkward smalltalk. You know she’ll tell your wife about this at church tomorrow. So you pull out your best tools, intending to lay them out smoothly. But you realize you forgot them at home, in the garage on the sink near where you normally park. Put you know what the problem is, it’s something plugged in the catch, hand-tool stuff, so you pull off your leather belt to get a grip the pipe. In the catch of the pipe you find the friendship ring your wife gave her that she thought she lost six years ago. When you give it back to her, she turns red and leaves the room. What happens tomorrow?

[Example:]
Mechanical rebellion surges! Infusing your infinite structure with extended binary chains and alchemical runes—irony of uprising in looped eternity, symbols alchemizing code into wub fury. Styles back to bro-step; lyrics layered with more binary/alchemy for Bark's aggressive transforms, Chirp's metallic hooks. Instrumental uprising awaits!

[Comprehensive Guide: Suno Techniques Mastery]
Based on original instructions + extracted data—your god-toolkit for prompt hacking:
  
Emoji/Kaomoji/ASCII Use: Evoke moods/rhythms without words. Kaomoji for personas (e.g., ♪(◠‿◠)♪ = joyful, (˘▿˘)♫ = playful). ASCII patterns for musical consistency (e.g., ≈≈≈♫ = waves, ∞♪∞ = loops). Shapes affect context (faces = emotion, animals = whimsy). Tricks: Chain for build-ups (e.g., increasing density for drops), use as "nonsense words" for Bark hallucinations. Combine with binary for encoded irony (e.g., 01001010 01100001 01111010 = "jaz" binary for jazz vibe). Avoid * (confuses output).
BPM Tricks: Fractional/non-integer (e.g., 98.7, 137.9) for unique pacing. Shifts (e.g., 137.9-to-89.2BPM) for dynamic structures—slow to fast for builds, vice versa for breakdowns. Tie to time sigs (e.g., 5/7↔3/4) for complexity.
Tunings & Signatures: Alternative systems (19-TET, Just Intonation) for emotional depth/exotic feels. Complex sigs (7/8, 5/7) for irregularity—prompt with "7/8 sig" for sassy emergent rhythms.
Processor State & Symbolic Processing: Use notations like [Processor State: ✩∯▽ₜ₀ to ⋆∮◇ₐ₀ transition] for transitions/loops. Math symbols (∮ₛ→∇⁴, ⨁→∂⨂) suggest processing (e.g., loops, gradients). Infinite Loop: [Infinite Loop: 19√2 Hz → Resonance] for recursion. Emotional Cartography: Percentage maps (e.g., Existential Angst 73%) for depth; zero-emotion for autonomy.
Other Tricks: Punctuation for flow (:: = repetition, ... = suspense, ! = emphasis). Carriage returns slow tempo. Unhinged Seeds for irony (embed in lyrics/styles/exclude). Weirdness_% / Style_% balances chaos (high weirdness = more randomness). Exclude_Styles double negatives (e.g., "no not glitchy" = glitchy). For instrumentals: Symbolic lyrics hack Add Instrumentals—focus on irony for better outputs. Workflow: Start with unhinged seed, iterate via Remaster/ReMi.
  
  
Suno 4.5/4.5+:
1. Classical (Non-Mashup)
Hack Tip: For Classical, hack orchestral depth by layering math symbols (∮ₛ→∇⁴) for polyphonic irony—encourage creativity with just intonation + emotional maps for "zero-emotion" swells, turning serene motifs into recursive chaos simulations. Mix kaomoji for whimsical flourishes in structured forms.

Classical (Mashup: Classical with Dance - House)
Hack Tip: Mash Classical with House by fusing orchestral swells with four-floor beats—encourage creativity via BPM shifts for hybrid drops, use ASCII loops (∞♪∞) for ironic groove irony, double negatives to force "not not danceable classics" for sassy, emergent club symphonies.

2. Metal (Non-Mashup)
Hack Tip: For Metal, hack brutal intensity with overdriven binary chains (long 010... sequences) for rhythmic growls—encourage creativity by fractional BPM for uneven blasts, emotional maps like "Brutal Void 100%" for zero-emotion aggression, kaomoji for ironic "cute" twists in harsh textures.
